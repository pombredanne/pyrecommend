This project is for now a personal sandbox as I read through some literature on
collabroative filtering and automated recommendations. This may perhaps one day
become a library for general use but right now it is not fit for... well
anything, really.

pyrecommend/ contains the actual recommendation package.
simplerec/ is a Django project used as a testbed.
